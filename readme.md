# Hockey User Manager

## What?
A basic user management app to allow teams to reduce the administrative process
required for player registration and tracking. The final product should allow
communication between clubs and teams and players, facilitate coaching and
scheduling, and overall reducte the amount of work volunteers must do to allow
players to be part of the game.

## Why?
Volunteers shouldn't be asked to do a lot of busy work. What started as an idea
for an exercise app specific to field hockey acticities has exploded into
something a little bit more. I want to make things easier for the administrative
side of a field hockey club, leaving more time for players to play, and less
time filling in forms or trying to figure out how to order kit.
